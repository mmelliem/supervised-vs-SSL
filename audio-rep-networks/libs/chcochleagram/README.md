# chcochleagram

PyTorch modules for cochleagram generation, allowing for gradient computations on the cochleagram generation graph. Cochleagrams are a variation on spectrograms  with filter shapes and widths motivated by human perception. Default arguments use half cosine filters at erb spacing. Custom filters can alternatively be provided. After initial (bandpass) filtering, the signals are envelope extracted, compressed, and downsampled to construct the cochleagram representation. 

## Installation
The easiest way to install chcochleagram is by pip installing directly from git: 

`pip install git+https://github.com/jenellefeather/chcochleagram.git`

Alternatively, you can clone the respository and run `pip install .` or other installation methods using the setup.py file. 

## Getting Started
